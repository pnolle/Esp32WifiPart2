# SnipDrop
This repo contains the Wi-Fi access point and client projects for my LED rollup banner project 'SnipSign 2.0'

## Sources
Based on the work of mo thunderz: https://github.com/mo-thunderz/Esp32WifiPart2 / https://youtu.be/15X0WvGaVg8

### Original Project: ESP32WebserverWebsocketJson.ino
Build upon ESP32Webserver.ino, which is a simple webserver for the ESP32. Just update the SSID and Password with that of your router, upload the INO to the ESP32 and compile. In the USB console it will provide the IP address of the ESP32 on your network. You can open a standard browser and navigate to this IP address. This will show a random number generated by the ESP32 on a simple web page. You can then alter this to show something more interesting :-)
ESP32WebserverWebsocketJson.ino includes websockets and JSON encapsulation for exchange of multiple variables between ESP32 and its clients.

## Installation
For installation, the following libraries need to be installed:
* Websockets by Markus Sattler (can be tricky to find -> search for "Arduino Websockets"
* ArduinoJson by Benoit Blanchon

Copy secrets.h_template and rename to secrets.h, fill in SSID and Password for ESP32 Wi-Fi.
